# Conclusion
So, there you have it. The largest Swift brain dump of currated Swift resources I have to offer <i>at the moment</i>, but rest assured there will be continual additions to come as I get further down the road. If there is something here you don't see (I'm sure there is), feel free to send a pull request my way and I'll get it in.

Happy Swifting!
